# Stellar-Simulator
The main objective of this project is to simulate the position of certain stars in the Milky Way in the HR Diagram, thus revealing,
the classification of the star in terms of the main sequence, its age and destiny.

In conclusion, it is expected to offer users knowledge regarding stellar evolution, especially with regard to stars
neighbors distributed in the Milky Way.

# HR Diagram
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, which relates the absolute magnitude, spectral type and temperature of stars, in which stars
They are distributed in a main sequence, for the most part. From a detailed study of this diagram, it is possible to determine the age of a star and estimate the next stages of its life, by knowing its position in the so-called main sequence. To create the Diagram, the
Hipparcos star catalog.

# Diagram Visualization
Through the HR Diagram, the user can view the position of the selected star in the Diagram in the main sequence.
In the project interface, the user can click on the name of the star to see more information about its evolution and
what your position on the diagram represents, such as your final "destination".

# Interface

In the interface under development, the user can view a representation of the surface and shape of the stars, in addition to having information
about its spectral classification.
